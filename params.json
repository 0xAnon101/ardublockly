{"name":"Ardublockly","tagline":"Visual programming for Arduino","body":"## Ardublockly\r\n\"Ardublockly\" is a fork of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), a web-based graphical programming editor, that has been updated to generate [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) code.\r\n\r\nThis project is influeced by BlocklyDuino, also based on an older version of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).\r\n\r\nThe \"ArduBlocklyServerCompiler\" component initialises a local server with Python to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software).\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* TBD\r\n\r\n![WebApp screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosperate/BlocklyDuino-BtW/20c0cf5048f18556c606adf8f1c0e92210de5f5a/images/screenshot_1.png)\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Running Ardublockly\r\n\r\nTo run the application execute the \"launch_arduino.py\".\r\n\r\n#### Required Software\r\n* [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/download), currently development is maintaining compatibility with  3.x\r\n* [Arduino IDE version 1.5 or higher](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)\r\n* Browser of your choice (currently supports Firefox, Chrome, IE8+, Opera and Safary)\r\n\r\n### Original Authors\r\n\r\nOriginal source is Copyright of Google Inc. [https://developers.google.com/blockly/](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Significant changes\r\nAdded Arduino code generator and Arduino app.\r\nAll changes to the original source code can be review [here](https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly/compare/blockly-original...master).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\").
